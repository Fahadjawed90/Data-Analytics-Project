# Data-Analytics-Project
This is an individual project created to test which method performs better on Raman Spectrometry Data. Either Linear regression or Neural Networks.

Raman Spectrometry is basically a measurement method to identify the spectrum of light when initiated through laser. This lets us examine spectrum data to clearly identify the patterns and since it has the labels so could be implemented using different models.The idea behind using this comparitive method is to find out which works better with the Raman Data.

The code is developed on Google colab while the dataset is uplaoded on my goggle drive. It is mounted via google drive and kept open so that you can run or downlaod it on your computer. The dataset is already cleaned and made useable for any type of command to reduce the number of occassional errors.  The link to the dataset is given below.

Smaller version of data is uplaoded on github.
