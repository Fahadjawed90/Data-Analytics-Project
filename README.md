# Data-Analytics-Project
This is an individual project created to tests which ones perform better on Raman Spectrometry Data. Either Linear regression or Neural Networks.

The code is develope don Google colab platform and dataset is uplaoded on my goggle drive. The dataset is mounted via google drive and kept open so that you can run or downlaod it on yoru computer.

The idea behind using this comparitive method is to find out which works better with the Raman Data. Since you alreday know that by now that Raman Spectrometry is basically a measurement method to identify the spectrum of light when initiated through laser. This lets us examines that spectrum data to clearly identify the labels and also implement different model on the same dataset.

The dataset is already cleaned and made useable for any type of command and it has been kept that way to reduced the numebro of occassional errors.
