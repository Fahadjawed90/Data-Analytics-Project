# Data-Analytics-Project
This is an individual project created to test which method performs better on Raman Spectrometry Data. Either Linear regression or Neural Networks.

The code is developed on Google colab while the dataset is uplaoded on my goggle drive. It is mounted via google drive and kept open so that you can run or downlaod it on your computer.

The idea behind using this comparitive method is to find out which works better with the Raman Data. Since you alreday know that by now that Raman Spectrometry is basically a measurement method to identify the spectrum of light when initiated through laser. This lets us examine spectrum data to clearly identify the patterns and since it has the labels so could be implemented using different models.

The dataset is already cleaned and made useable for any type of command and it has been kept that way to reduced the number of occassional errors.
